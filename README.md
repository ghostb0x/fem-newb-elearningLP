# E-Learning Landing Page - Design from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) 

This landing page is for a fake E-learning business. It uses a design from Frontend Mentor, which creates coding challenges for front end dev practice.

In this case, the landing page designs were provided via a figma design file for mobile, tablet, and desktop styles.

You can see the comparison between my work and the original on [my Frontend Mentor solution page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-page-with-react-styledcomponents-7JCe_jaNfl).

## Built with React and styled-components

Although there is no use of React features (e.g. useState or useEffect hooks), making this page essentially just a standard HTML/CSS document, I built this page using React and styled-components.

This is my default way of building anything at present, as I have a customized boilerplate template that combines Create React App defaults with various other npm packages that I like to use (e.g. styled-components and Josh Comeau's opinionated new-component package).
