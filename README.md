# Typemaster Landing Page - Design from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io) 

This project uses a design from Frontend Mentor, which creates coding challenges for front end dev practice.

In this case, the landing page designs were provided via a figma design file for mobile, tablet, and desktop styles.

You can see the comparison between my work and the original on [my Frontend Mentor solution page](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/responsive-page-with-react-styledcomponents-7JCe_jaNfl).
